Hey! Thank you so much for visiting my GitHub profile.

My name is Ben Craddock. I am currently studying Full Stack Web Development and Computer Science at Bloom Institute of Technology (BloomTech, formerly known as Lambda School). Previously, I graduated from Penn State University in 2019 with a degree in Economics and worked for two years as a consultant for EY (Ernst & Young, LLP).

During my time at BloomTech and through my independent projects, I have been able to learn and master the following skills:

- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, Redux, Axios, Cypress, Jest, Styled Components, Tailwind CSS, Next.js, Authentication, Vercel, Firebase, and Material UI.

- Backend: Node, Express, SQLiteStudio, PostgreSQL, PgAdmin 4, Postman, HTTPie, JSON, JSON Web Tokens, Authentication, Authorization, Heroku, and Testing.

In addition, I am well versed in Visual Studio Code, Debugging, Git, GitHub, and Terminal. I am passionate about Web3, Crypto, and NFT's and am independently learning Solidity to be able to develop smart contracts on the Ethereum Blockhain.
