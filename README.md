Hey! Thank you so much for visiting my GitHub profile.

My name is Ben Craddock. I am currently studying Full Stack Web Development and Computer Science at Bloom Institute of Technology (BloomTech, formerly known as Lambda School). Previously, I graduated from Penn State University in 2019 with a degree in Economics and worked for two years as a consultant for EY (Ernst & Young, LLP).

During my time at BloomTech and through my independent projects, I have been able to learn and master the following skills:

- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, Redux, Axios, Cypress, Jest, Styled Components, Tailwind CSS, Next.js, Authentication, Vercel, Firebase, and Material UI.

- Backend: Node, Express, SQLiteStudio, PostgreSQL, PgAdmin 4, Postman, HTTPie, JSON, JSON Web Tokens, Authorization, Heroku, and Testing.

In addition, I am well versed in Visual Studio Code, Debugging, Git, GitHub, and Terminal. I am passionate about Web3, Crypto, and NFT's and I am currently learning Solidity and how to code smart contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain independently while seeking all kinds of developer opportunities in Web3 as part of my dream to create product and value for the masses.
