- 👋 Hi, I’m Ben :)
- 🐻‍❄️ I graduated Penn State University in 2019 with an Economics degree and a gained passion for technology and entrepreneurship.
- 🏙 Post graduation, I lived in NYC for one year and worked for EY in their International Tax and Transaction Advisory practice.
- 😷 Then, 2020 and the pandemic happened, so I moved back home and worked remotely for one year.
- 💭 After months of conversation with my family, friends, and mentors, combined with a lot of meditation and prayer, I decided to quit my job and pursue a technical career. 🙀
- 🚀 I started my programming journey in Full Stack Web Development as part of cohort 49 at Lambda School in September 2021.
- And the rest is to be continued!

- 👀 I’m interested in NFT's, sneakers, anime, sneakers, fashion, sports, tech, and cryptocurrency.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning/have learned HTML5, CSS3, Git and GitHub, JavaScript, and ReactJS as part of Lambda School's Full Stack Web Development course, and have dabbled with Solidity, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Firebase V9 and Authentication during my free time.
- 🔜 I'll be learning more React, Redux, Node, Python and more in the coming months.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building apps and websites.
